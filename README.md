## Seek Data Leakage Platform 

## Synopsis
The World Wide Web and the Deep Web are today the main focus for exposing and hosting confidential corporate information. 
Adicionally, many of these coporate information systems are compromised, being easy to resort to online services to check the existence of vulnerabilites and exhibition services/information that could potentially put the organization at risk.
Nowadays individuals and businesses face serious problems of data loss and information that can later be disclosed and used for malicious purposes.
In most cases, organizations are reactive and not proactive against information leakage and analysis of the data infrastructure that are exposed in multiple services on the World Wide Web.
Based on this problem we have developed a platform that aims to to overcome this problem.
